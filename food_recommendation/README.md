# Food Recommendation

## Aims
- Develop a model that recommends lunch menu
- The model concerns two factors: preferences and the last time he/she ate
- a data will be given in one hot vector format that represent time series menu selection

## Implemented
- The model calculate the preferences with basic statistical method and linear function
- One's prefrence = how many times he/she ate the food / how many times he/she ate the food * sigmoid(last time he/she ate the food)

## Further Work
- Applying Naive Baysian 
- Applying graph model
- Applying RNN
