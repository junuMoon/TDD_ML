## Variable Notes

pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

## Target variable
- Survived:
    - 0: died, 549(61.6%)
    - 1: survived, 342(38.4%)

## Null Percentage

'Embarked', 'Age', 'Cabin' needs to be imputed.

#### Comments

- Male survivor percent is extremly lower thatn Female's
- `Embarked` refers to location. Is will be a factor of survivor?
- In `Parch`, value 1 has the highest survivor proportion. 
- In `SibSp`, value 3 has the highest survivor proportion.
